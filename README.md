# Suicide-Rate-Regression-Model
Here I aim to understand the factors which determine who is at the greatest risk of suicide using Python. I used the 'Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016' dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016). 

**I answered the research questions below:**
1. Do suicide numbers differ across age groups?  (using one-way ANOVA)
2. Do suicide numbers differ between gender? (using independent t-test)
3. Is there a relationship between suicide numbers and GDP? (using Spearman's correlation, reasonings explained)
4. Is there a trend in suicide numbers overtime as a whole? (using Seasonal Mann Kendall Trend Test)

Additionally, I created a **regression prediction model** to predict the number of suicides given GDP data and other demographic variables. Models used include linear regression, decision tree and random forest.
