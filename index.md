## Project aim
Suicide is prevalent in our society with 800,000 individuals worldwide taking their lives every year, which is one person every 40 seconds (World Health Organisation, 2019). Despite these figures most countries do not have a national strategy to prevent these suicides from taking place.

I aim to answer the primary question: What factors are key in determining who is at the greatest risk of suicide? This is done by understanding the relationships between suicide rates and Gross Domestic Product (GDP), generation effects (including age) and gender, using the following sub-questions:

1. Do suicide rates differ across generations (i.e., age groups)?
2. Do suicide rates differ between gender?
3. Is there a relationship between suicide rates and GDP?
4. Is there a trend in suicide rates overtime as a whole?
5. Given GDP data and other demographic variables can suicide numbers be predicted?

Within the research community it is expected that the findings from this project will extract greater insights into the trends of suicide rates and generate benefit for further studies into suicidal tendencies in key countries and target demographics. The key learnings in the study may also be generalised to the application of suicide prevention strategies in each country.
